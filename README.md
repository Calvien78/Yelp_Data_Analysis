# Yelp_Data_Analysis

This is the first job I handled in the first month of learning SQL.
The topic is to think about an in-depth question based on Yelp's data set, and the topic I chose after careful consideration is:

Analyzing how business characteristics (location, operating hours, etc.) influence user reviews.

I generated a clean data set through data cleaning, filtering, and re-coding part of the data, and then conducted regression analysis through Python.
The output is surprising: the business hours, geographical location, and business photos are not factors affecting the user rating; On the contrary, whether a business accepts credit cards and the total number of reviews received by the business have significant characteristics. It is further speculated that businesses may charge unreasonable fees when charging credit cards, leading to negative comments from users. A business with a large number of user reviews indicates that it is very popular, and more and more people visit the restaurant after reading the reviews and leaving more positive ratings.
